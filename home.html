            Java is a programming language and a platform based on object-oriented programming concepts. It was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
            There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless Java is being installed, and more are created every day. Java is high level, fast, secure, and reliable. 
            From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!
            Java language will be used throughout this workbook to understand OOP.

        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data. Object-oriented programming takes the view that what are really cared about are the objects that is to be manipulated rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 
        The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, known as data modeling. Once an object has been identified, it is generalized as a class of objects which defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it.
        The building of OOP is based on following four pillars. </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            A graphical user interface (GUI) presents a user friendly mechanism for interacting with an application. GUIs are built from GUI components. These are sometimes called controls or widgets. A GUI component is an object with which the user interacts via mouse, 
            the keyboard, or another form of input.
